<!-- adding script near bottom for best practice w/ load times-->
    <script src="./index.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
<!-- for some reason adding type="javascript" or type="js" prevent the
 script from loading in liveserver in both chrome and firefox. 
 couldn't figure out why it wasn't working and removing that fixed it?-->

 <!-- oh looks like i needed text/javascript for type (omitting it works the 
  same as type/javascript is its default if nothing is added there. 
  looks like chrome devtools might still show even if it's just "javascript" 
  but ff did not allow it to run that way. good to know! -->
